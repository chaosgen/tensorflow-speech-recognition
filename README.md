# Tensorflow speech-recognition
Speech recognition using google's tensorflow deep learning framework, [sequence-to-sequence](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/seq2seq/index.html) neural networks

(Replaces [caffe-speech-recognition](https://github.com/pannous/caffe-speech-recognition) )

Extensions to current tensorflow probably needed:

* [Sliding Window GPU implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/211)
* FFT / speech feature extraction preprocessing ( or same model with pretraining?)
* Continuous seq2seq adaptation

**Collaborators wanted!** We are in the process of tackling this project in seriousness. Drop an email to info@pannous.com if you want to join the party, no matter your background.
